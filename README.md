# Sudoku Solver
This application uses the <b>Backtracking Algorithm</b> to generate a solution for the Sudoku that has been given by the user. The algorithm is adapted to solve the Sudoku that iterates all the possible solutions for the given Sudoku. If the solutions assigned do not lead to the solution of the Sudoku, the algorithm discards the solution and rolls back to the original solution and tries again. <br> <br>
<b>Features of the Program:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Enables user to enter a Sudoku which program can solve.</li>
  <li>Enables user to solve stored Sudoku puzzles from different difficulty levels.</li>
  <li>Enables user to check if his/her solution is correct.</li>
